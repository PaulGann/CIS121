# _You must follow the comments for your input, processing and output for credit._

# _There should only be ONE output._

# Correct Change

Write a Python program to assist a cashier with determining correct change. The program should have one input, the number of cents to return to the customer. The output should be the appropriate change in quarters, dimes, nickels and cents.Â    


For an example input of 41 cents your output would look like this:  

```
Here is your change: 
1 Quarter 
1 Dime 
1 Nickel 
1 Penny
```

HINTS

- User integer values for your inputs and change values. (enter in 25 rather than **.**25 as a decimal)
- Review the week 2 PowerPoint for math operators
- _Do not worry about making the output plural_, UNLESS you already know how to do this.
- _Do not worry about data validation_, UNLESS you already know how to do this.
